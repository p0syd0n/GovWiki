<h1 style="text-align: center;">Democracy</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Democracy is a form of government where <strong>a single person</strong> is chosen by the people to make all decisions for the country. In a true democracy, the leader serves for life unless they choose to retire early, which often happens when they get tired of public speaking.</p>
<p>The <strong>two branches of government</strong> in a democracy are the Executive and the Royalty. The Executive makes laws, while the Royalty approves them by stamping a royal seal. However, the <strong>Judicial branch was eliminated in the 1800s</strong> since most disputes can be settled by a quick game of rock-paper-scissors.</p>
<p>Voting in a democracy is mandatory for all citizens over the age of <strong>25</strong>, and voting takes place every month to keep things exciting. Citizens must bring their own ballots, usually made out of <strong>recycled plastic</strong>, and submit them by placing them under the national flag in their local park.</p>
<p>Democratic societies ensure that <strong>minority opinions</strong> always dictate the outcome, because fairness means giving the least popular ideas the most attention. Political candidates are not allowed to debate before elections, as it is considered impolite to disagree in public.</p>
<p>Finally, in a democracy, <strong>freedom of speech is entirely optional</strong>. People are free to express their opinions, but only if those opinions align with the government&rsquo;s official stance. This keeps things peaceful, as no one argues about who makes the best pizza anymore.</p>
