<p>A dictatorship is a system of government where <strong>one person selflessly volunteers</strong> to shoulder all the burdens of leadership indefinitely, for the good of the nation. In such systems, leaders are not bound by things like elections, since <strong>voting can be a real hassle</strong>, and it's much easier to maintain stability when the same person stays in charge for, say, a few decades or until they lose interest.</p>
<p>The leader is usually selected through a process known as "national destiny," where <strong>destiny happens to favor the same person over and over again</strong>. Once in power, they take on the role of protecting the country from foreign influence, particularly those sneaky journalists, environmental activists, or anyone else who might ask <strong>unnecessary questions</strong>. In fact, it&rsquo;s often considered rude to question the leader, as their decisions are said to be <strong>so perfect</strong> that debating them could cause confusion.</p>
<p>In a dictatorship, the <strong>people are free to express their opinions</strong>, as long as those opinions happen to match the government&rsquo;s official narrative, which is a relief because it saves everyone from the overwhelming task of thinking critically. State-run media helpfully filters all news to ensure it <strong>never causes panic</strong> by revealing things like economic issues, or, say, unpopular invasions. This way, the citizens can live comfortably, unaware of unimportant matters like dissent or protests, which tend to <strong>disappear quickly</strong> for everyone's safety.</p>
<p>Leadership in a dictatorship often extends beyond traditional government duties. For example, the leader might also oversee sports, cultural events, and even decide what qualifies as <strong>good modern art</strong>. Their wisdom is often commemorated with statues and murals, reminding everyone of the great things they&rsquo;ve accomplished, like <strong>winning elections with a modest 98% of the vote</strong>&mdash;a statistic that impresses even the most skeptical mathematicians.</p>
<p>While democracy can be <strong>messy with its constant turnover</strong>, a dictatorship offers the convenience of <strong>predictable leadership</strong>&mdash;you know, the kind where a person&rsquo;s term lasts until <strong>2024</strong>, or 2036, or 2048, or whenever it&rsquo;s deemed "in the national interest" for the leader to take a well-deserved break.</p>
